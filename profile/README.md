# HashnodeNG 
formerly known as - Angular Headless Hashnode
## [![Discord](https://github.com/monacodelisa/icons-and-graphics/blob/main/icomoon/PNG/discord.png?raw=true)](https://discord.gg/3bS3xpCj) Open Source Project 

## Overview 

The **Angular Headless Hashnode Project** aims to seamlessly connect your Angular application to the Hashnode GraphQL database, providing a template for integrating Angular with a headless Hashnode setup.

In other words - this project is very much like the starter kit that Hashnode provides, except that this project uses Angular for the frontend and deployment is set to be done through Netlify.

## Project Goals

- Develop a flexible template for Angular integration with headless Hashnode.
- Connect the Angular app to Hashnode's GraphQL database to retrieve posts and blog data.
- Responsive layout improvements for different devices
- Support Angular v17 and up
